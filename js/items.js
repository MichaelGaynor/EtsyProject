I am not responsible for lost or stolen international orders where I can guarantee the box was shipped by providing you with a shipping receipt on paper.

This series will constantly be growing as time goes on...\n\nABOUT THE SHIRT:\nPrinted on super soft heathered tees, they are perfect for lounging around the house all day, or outfitting with your favorite flannel and skirt for a day out.  In our minds, a good tee is the perfect base for any outfit.\nThe fit of these runs about a size small in the women&#39;s style, so size up if you don&#39;t want it to fit you too tight.  If your unsure, grab your favorite fitting tee and compare the measurements with the size chart below.  Weve included both the women&#39;s and unisex for size comparisons.  The biggest difference in style between these is that the women&#39;s neckline scoops a bit lower and they are more fitted, where as the unisex ones are a bit longer, more boxy and have a higher neckline (and of course are more true to men&#39;s sizing).  But they both are made from super soft heathered material that just feels so good on!  All inks used are eco-friendly water based inks.\n\n**Size note: Model is wearing the women&#39;s size medium, and is 5&#39;2&quot; and 115 lbs.**\n**Material is: Tri-Blend (50% Polyester \/ 25% Ring-Spun Cotton \/ 25% Rayon) **\n**Color is heather tri-coffee (sort of a light brown)**\n\nSIZE CHART:\nWomen&#39;s Small \/\/  Size 0-2 \/\/ Chest Width 16-7\/8&quot;

This pyrite ammonite has been polished to a shine and the little chambers in the shell shine with druzy crystals. It&#39;s very cool!\n\nThe ammonite measures 20mm and is accented with AAA faceted garnet, citrine and peridot of rich color to compliment the shiny gold pyrite. It dangles from a large AAA whiskey quartz nugget. The chain is comprised of clusters of AAA garnet 4-5mm faceted onion briolettes alternating with whiskey quartz nuggets. The last 1.5 inches of the necklace are a simple gold filled cable chain.\nThe overall length of the necklace is 17 inches. It is finished with a sturdy, gold filled lobster clasp. This necklace is very well made, and will last a lifetime.\n\nPLEASE feel free to convo me with any questions!

Please respect the intellectual property of all artists, artisans and crafters and be inspired, but be original!\r\n\r\nHere is some information about Gold in it&#39;s various forms \u2014\r\nThe key difference between 14\/20 gold fill and gold plate or vermeil is this: \r\nBoth gold-plate and vermeil are created using an electro-chemical processes. Gold plate is placing a thin molecule of gold over a base metal, and vermeil places a slightly thicker layer of gold over sterling silver. \r\n\r\nIn the processes of gold plating and vermeil, the coating will wear off and tarnish\u2026 in the case of gold plating possibly as soon as 3-6 months and in the case of vermeil possibly as soon as 1-2 years (depending on use). Vermeil will also tarnish and darken with age because the gold does not adhere fully to the silver, and the silver continues to tarnish under the gold.\r\n\r\n14\/20 gold-fill is created by heat-and-pressure-bonding a layer of gold to a brass (semi-precious metal) core. 14\/20 gold filled has a layer of gold that is more than 100 times thicker than even the highest quality vermeil or gold plating, and is measured not by thickness but by weight.  The term 14\/20 gold-filled means that the gold layer must be at least 1\/20th (5%) of the overall product, by weight.\r\n\r\nA 14\/20 Gold Filled piece is usually considered a lifetime piece of jewelry. Beware of the difference! Under the same care that you would give any precious metal jewelry, 14KGF jewelry will not peel, flake, or wear off and can be treasured as heirloom pieces. Gold-filled jewelry, unlike gold plated jewelry, can be polished and cleaned with jewelry cleaner. The layer of gold will not rub off or wear out. It is tarnish-resistant like solid 14 karat gold and is safe for most people with sensitive skin who can wear solid 14 karat gold jewelry. \r\n","policy_seller_info":null,"policy_updated_tsz":1442535308,"vacation_autoreply":"Hello!\r\n\r\nYour message is very important to me.

It will also hold 28oz (850ml) of his finest malted beverage. \n\nEach decanter comes in a beautiful gift box.\n\nSize: 8.5\u201d x 3.5\u201d x 3.5\u201d\n\n**DURING CHECKOUT**\nPlease leave your personalization request (name and birth year where applicable by design style) and preferred style in the Notes to Seller when you checkout.\n\nPlease contact us with any questions.\n\nPlease Note: \n*Whiskey not included (we would if we could!)\n**For orders outside of the USA, it is down to the discretion of the customs agency in your territory whether customs will be charged on the import of this item. It&#39;s unusual, but can happen. Any fees incurred are the responsibility of the purchaser.","creation_tsz":1444310818,"ending_tsz":1454941618,"original_creation_tsz":1414558231,"last_modified_tsz":1444310818,"price":"44.99","currency_code":"USD","quantity":610,"tags":["Groomsmen gift","Groomsmens gift","Customized decanter","Boyfriend gift","Fathers gift","whiskey decanter","Best mans gift","Unique mens gift","liquor decanter","Custom decanter","personalized gift","mens gift","glass decanter"],"category_path":["Housewares"],"category_path_ids":[69150425],"materials":["Glass"],"shop_section_id":16339825,"featured_rank":1,"state_tsz":1444194551,"url":"https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/listing\/208931344\/groomsmen-gift-personalized-whiskey?utm_source=theironyardteaching&utm_medium=api&utm_campaign=api","views":20510,"num_favorers":1223,"shipping_template_id":6742413491,"processing_min":3,"processing_max":5,"who_made":"i_did","is_supply":"false","when_made":"made_to_order","item_weight":"62","item_weight_units":null,"item_length":"13","item_width":"7","item_height":"7","item_dimensions_unit":"in","is_private":false,"recipient":null,"occasion":null,"style":null,"non_taxable":false,"is_customizable":false,"is_digital":false,"file_data":"","language":"en-US","has_variations":false,"taxonomy_id":891,"taxonomy_path":["Home & Living"],"used_manufacturer":false,"Images":[{"listing_image_id":745560744,"hex_code":"694933","red":105,"green":73,"blue":51,"hue":24,"saturation":51,"brightness":41,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1426976712,"listing_id":208931344,"rank":1,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/057\/3\/9997414\/il_75x75.745560744_9880.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/057\/3\/9997414\/il_170x135.745560744_9880.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/057\/3\/9997414\/il_570xN.745560744_9880.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/057\/3\/9997414\/il_fullxfull.745560744_9880.jpg","full_height":1255,"full_width":1500},{"listing_image_id":745663580,"hex_code":"806C4D","red":128,"green":108,"blue":77,"hue":36,"saturation":39,"brightness":50,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1426993091,"listing_id":208931344,"rank":2,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/059\/0\/9997414\/il_75x75.745663580_55fa.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/059\/0\/9997414\/il_170x135.745663580_55fa.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/059\/0\/9997414\/il_570xN.745663580_55fa.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/059\/0\/9997414\/il_fullxfull.745663580_55fa.jpg","full_height":1261,"full_width":1500},{"listing_image_id":742494260,"hex_code":"9F5B41","red":159,"green":91,"blue":65,"hue":17,"saturation":59,"brightness":62,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1426466116,"listing_id":208931344,"rank":3,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/055\/0\/9997414\/il_75x75.742494260_7p94.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/055\/0\/9997414\/il_170x135.742494260_7p94.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/055\/0\/9997414\/il_570xN.742494260_7p94.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/055\/0\/9997414\/il_fullxfull.742494260_7p94.jpg","full_height":1417,"full_width":1500},{"listing_image_id":745560818,"hex_code":"663D23","red":102,"green":61,"blue":35,"hue":23,"saturation":65,"brightness":40,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1426976713,"listing_id":208931344,"rank":4,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/054\/0\/9997414\/il_75x75.745560818_7bur.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/054\/0\/9997414\/il_170x135.745560818_7bur.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/054\/0\/9997414\/il_570xN.745560818_7bur.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/054\/0\/9997414\/il_fullxfull.745560818_7bur.jpg","full_height":1125,"full_width":1500},{"listing_image_id":674054119,"hex_code":"C2C0C0","red":194,"green":192,"blue":192,"hue":0,"saturation":1,"brightness":76,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1414558232,"listing_id":208931344,"rank":5,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/048\/0\/9997414\/il_75x75.674054119_sf0s.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/048\/0\/9997414\/il_170x135.674054119_sf0s.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/048\/0\/9997414\/il_570xN.674054119_sf0s.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/048\/0\/9997414\/il_fullxfull.674054119_sf0s.jpg","full_height":540,"full_width":720}],"Shop":{"shop_id":9997414,"shop_name":"SwankyBadgerDesign","user_id":53317163,"creation_tsz":1414552657,"title":"Personalized Groomsmen Gifts and Men&#39;s Gifts","announcement":"Unique, customized gifts for men, that will be displayed with pride for years to come.

Welcome!  The best sources for these vintage prints are old magazines published during the 1930s to early 1960s.  \r\n\r\nThe vintage ad or illustration you see on Etsy is the one you will receive.  I have personally removed the page from its original source, trimmed as needed, and carefully packaged it in archival materials for protection and preservation.   There are no reproductions or copies in my shop - these are all original vintage pages.\r\n\r\nOften, one page has two equally gorgeous illustrations, one on the front and the other on the back.  I choose the one that I think is the more fabulous side, but you are free to frame either (tough choice most of the time!).\r\n\r\nI\u2019m very interested in preserving these historic gems, which are between 50 and 90 years old.  They may have small spots, tears, or slight discoloration, character marks which only make them more unique.

If you see something that you really love, but you still want to think about before purchasing, just let me know.  I\u2019ll gladly put it on hold for 48 hours.  After this, it will be available for anyone to purchase.  \r\n\r\n\u25ba PHOTOGRAPHING FOR THE WEB \u25c4\r\nMost of the magazines published during the 1930s-1960s were printed in a larger format than will fit on a standard scanner.  For this reason, I use my digital camera with a black background to block any content from the reverse side and to provide a nice contrast so you can see the edges of the paper.  \r\n\r\nThe degree of paper transparency completely depends on the type of paper the publisher used.  I\u2019ve found that earlier publications used heavier paper for color prints with no see-through to the other side.  Some black and white pages are on especially thin paper.  \r\n\r\nPlease keep in mind that monitor resolutions vary considerably.  Just because I may be seeing one thing on my Mac doesn\u2019t mean you will see the exact same colors on your PC or mobile device.  Variations won\u2019t be significant, but may be present.  \r\n\r\n\u25ba FINISHING YOUR VINTAGE PRINT \u25c4\r\nEach vintage print is sold unmatted and unframed; the cropped and\/or framed images are intended to provide inspiration only.  Here are some of the ways to finish your collectible print:\r\n\r\n----- ORIGINAL PACKAGING -----\r\nAfter I have removed the page from its original print source (usually a vintage magazine), I\u2019ll trim the edges, photograph, then package with archival white backing boards and poly sleeves.  If you are a collector, you may keep a file with vintage ads or illustrations so they are neatly organized and easily accessible.  Keeping the print in the packaging I prepare is absolutely fine for keeping it safe from the elements.  I do this myself! \r\n\r\n----- ARCHIVAL ALBUM -----\r\nMany collectors choose to display their ads in an archival album.  This way, they can keep ads with a common theme together (e.g., St. Mary\u2019s Blanket ads) and flip through leisurely, enjoying their collection.\r\n\r\n----- MATTING & FRAMING -----\r\nOther collectors choose to frame and display vintage artwork in their home or office, or especially to give as gifts.  I have purposely left enough margin space for matting.  I recommend heading to your local frame shop for custom mats because it\u2019s easy and you can get expert advice on colors and frame options.  They should be able to provide black FoamCor backing for framing (white is the standard).  This wonderful archival board won\u2019t show through the piece, but will ensure the image is as clear as possible.  It\u2019s a simple, yet effective trick I\u2019ve used for years.  Do not use black poster board as it has acid that will degrade the paper.  Some paper is thick enough that the reverse image does not show at all, so white backing is fine.  Please let me know if you have more questions about this process.  \r\n\r\n----- SHOULD I FRAME THE WHOLE PAGE OR ONLY THE ILLUSTRATION? -----\r\nIf framing, you may choose to showcase the entire advertisement or only the illustrated section.  It really depends on whether you are collecting the advertisement or artwork (or both).  An example are the 1950s Saturday Evening Post covers, which had a fair amount of print toward the top and a fun illustration toward the bottom 3\/4.  If you collect Post covers, you would probably frame the entire cover, words and all.  If you just love the nostalgic image but find the words distracting, you may decide to show only the illustrated portion.  I think both options are fine, but some purists would disagree with me.  My main interest is seeing these colorful gems preserved and enjoyed.  Keep in mind a mat covers up part of the page, so you can frame it while leaving the full page intact.","policy_seller_info":null,"policy_updated_tsz":1441058122,"vacation_autoreply":null,"url":"https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/shop\/RetroReveries?utm_source=theironyardteaching&utm_medium=api&utm_campaign=api","image_url_760x100":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/045\/0\/9430690\/iusb_760x100.14408385_7pdq.jpg","num_favorers":352,"languages":["en-US"],"upcoming_local_event_id":null,"icon_url_fullxfull":null}},{"listing_id":206711555,"state":"active","user_id":11844337,"category_id":68891034,"title":"1944 G&W Five Star Blended Whiskey Ad - Great Day of Discovery - Viking Long Ship Model Art - 1940s Alcohol Ads","description":"Vintage 1940s G&W Five Star Blended Whiskey Ad\n\nWhat a Great Day of Discovery!

If you see something that you really love, but you still want to think about before purchasing, just let me know.  I\u2019ll gladly put it on hold for 48 hours.  After this, it will be available for anyone to purchase.  \r\n\r\n\u25ba PHOTOGRAPHING FOR THE WEB \u25c4\r\nMost of the magazines published during the 1930s-1960s were printed in a larger format than will fit on a standard scanner.  For this reason, I use my digital camera with a black background to block any content from the reverse side and to provide a nice contrast so you can see the edges of the paper.  \r\n\r\nThe degree of paper transparency completely depends on the type of paper the publisher used.  I\u2019ve found that earlier publications used heavier paper for color prints with no see-through to the other side.  Some black and white pages are on especially thin paper.  \r\n\r\nPlease keep in mind that monitor resolutions vary considerably.  Just because I may be seeing one thing on my Mac doesn\u2019t mean you will see the exact same colors on your PC or mobile device.  Variations won\u2019t be significant, but may be present.  \r\n\r\n\u25ba FINISHING YOUR VINTAGE PRINT \u25c4\r\nEach vintage print is sold unmatted and unframed; the cropped and\/or framed images are intended to provide inspiration only.  Here are some of the ways to finish your collectible print:\r\n\r\n----- ORIGINAL PACKAGING -----\r\nAfter I have removed the page from its original print source (usually a vintage magazine), I\u2019ll trim the edges, photograph, then package with archival white backing boards and poly sleeves.  If you are a collector, you may keep a file with vintage ads or illustrations so they are neatly organized and easily accessible.  Keeping the print in the packaging I prepare is absolutely fine for keeping it safe from the elements.  I do this myself! \r\n\r\n----- ARCHIVAL ALBUM -----\r\nMany collectors choose to display their ads in an archival album.  This way, they can keep ads with a common theme together (e.g., St. Mary\u2019s Blanket ads) and flip through leisurely, enjoying their collection.\r\n\r\n----- MATTING & FRAMING -----\r\nOther collectors choose to frame and display vintage artwork in their home or office, or especially to give as gifts.  I have purposely left enough margin space for matting.  I recommend heading to your local frame shop for custom mats because it\u2019s easy and you can get expert advice on colors and frame options.  They should be able to provide black FoamCor backing for framing (white is the standard).  This wonderful archival board won\u2019t show through the piece, but will ensure the image is as clear as possible.  It\u2019s a simple, yet effective trick I\u2019ve used for years.  Do not use black poster board as it has acid that will degrade the paper.  Some paper is thick enough that the reverse image does not show at all, so white backing is fine.  Please let me know if you have more questions about this process.  \r\n\r\n----- SHOULD I FRAME THE WHOLE PAGE OR ONLY THE ILLUSTRATION? -----\r\nIf framing, you may choose to showcase the entire advertisement or only the illustrated section.  It really depends on whether you are collecting the advertisement or artwork (or both).  An example are the 1950s Saturday Evening Post covers, which had a fair amount of print toward the top and a fun illustration toward the bottom 3\/4.  If you collect Post covers, you would probably frame the entire cover, words and all.  If you just love the nostalgic image but find the words distracting, you may decide to show only the illustrated portion.  I think both options are fine, but some purists would disagree with me.  My main interest is seeing these colorful gems preserved and enjoyed.  Keep in mind a mat covers up part of the page, so you can frame it while leaving the full page intact.","policy_seller_info":null,"policy_updated_tsz":1441058122,"vacation_autoreply":null,"url":"https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/shop\/RetroReveries?utm_source=theironyardteaching&utm_medium=api&utm_campaign=api","image_url_760x100":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/045\/0\/9430690\/iusb_760x100.14408385_7pdq.jpg","num_favorers":352,"languages":["en-US"],"upcoming_local_event_id":null,"icon_url_fullxfull":null}},{"listing_id":206667318,"state":"active","user_id":11844337,"category_id":68891034,"title":"Vintage 1946 Schenley Blended Whiskey Ad - Rooster Crowing - 1940s Alcohol Ad - Keith Ward Art - Apple Blossoms Orchard - Midcentury America","description":"Vintage 1940s Schenley Reserve Ad\n\n1946 Schenley&#39;s blended whiskey - Blended right for pleasure bright!

Remember that shipping is charged for the first item only; subsequent items in the order are shipped free to this address.  \r\n\r\nTracking is included on all US orders, but has to be purchased separately on international orders (it&#39;s really expensive).  \r\n\r\nPlease note that any customs fees, taxes, or duties are the responsibility of the buyer, so please be aware of your country&#39;s policies.  I am unable to declare something as a gift due to legal restrictions.\r\n\r\n\u25ba DELIVERY \u25c4 \r\nIf you feel like you should have received your order but haven\u2019t, please contact me so I can look into it for you.  Please contact me immediately if your order has been damaged en route - photos from every angle will help.","policy_refunds":"If you need to cancel your order for any reason, please contact me immediately. I process orders very quickly, so once it\u2019s been shipped, I can\u2019t stop the order.\r\n\r\nRefunds and exchanges are considered on an individual basis, and return shipping is the buyer\u2019s responsibility.  That being said, I hope you are absolutely thrilled with your Retro Reveries purchase!  As you can tell from my descriptions, I really love each piece I sell, so it\u2019s important to me that you are equally pleased.  \r\n\r\nIf you are unhappy with your order for any reason, please contact me within 5 business days of receiving your order.  ","policy_additional":"\u25ba HOLDS & RESERVES \u25c4 \r\nHow frustrating to have an item you\u2019ve been watching online disappear before you could buy it!  If you see something that you really love, but you still want to think about before purchasing, just let me know.  I\u2019ll gladly put it on hold for 48 hours.  After this, it will be available for anyone to purchase.  \r\n\r\n\u25ba PHOTOGRAPHING FOR THE WEB \u25c4\r\nMost of the magazines published during the 1930s-1960s were printed in a larger format than will fit on a standard scanner.  For this reason, I use my digital camera with a black background to block any content from the reverse side and to provide a nice contrast so you can see the edges of the paper.  \r\n\r\nThe degree of paper transparency completely depends on the type of paper the publisher used.  I\u2019ve found that earlier publications used heavier paper for color prints with no see-through to the other side.  Some black and white pages are on especially thin paper.  \r\n\r\nPlease keep in mind that monitor resolutions vary considerably.  Just because I may be seeing one thing on my Mac doesn\u2019t mean you will see the exact same colors on your PC or mobile device.  Variations won\u2019t be significant, but may be present.  \r\n\r\n\u25ba FINISHING YOUR VINTAGE PRINT \u25c4\r\nEach vintage print is sold unmatted and unframed; the cropped and\/or framed images are intended to provide inspiration only.  Here are some of the ways to finish your collectible print:\r\n\r\n----- ORIGINAL PACKAGING -----\r\nAfter I have removed the page from its original print source (usually a vintage magazine), I\u2019ll trim the edges, photograph, then package with archival white backing boards and poly sleeves.  If you are a collector, you may keep a file with vintage ads or illustrations so they are neatly organized and easily accessible.  Keeping the print in the packaging I prepare is absolutely fine for keeping it safe from the elements.  I do this myself! \r\n\r\n----- ARCHIVAL ALBUM -----\r\nMany collectors choose to display their ads in an archival album.  This way, they can keep ads with a common theme together (e.g., St. Mary\u2019s Blanket ads) and flip through leisurely, enjoying their collection.\r\n\r\n----- MATTING & FRAMING -----\r\nOther collectors choose to frame and display vintage artwork in their home or office, or especially to give as gifts.  I have purposely left enough margin space for matting.  I recommend heading to your local frame shop for custom mats because it\u2019s easy and you can get expert advice on colors and frame options.  They should be able to provide black FoamCor backing for framing (white is the standard).  This wonderful archival board won\u2019t show through the piece, but will ensure the image is as clear as possible.  It\u2019s a simple, yet effective trick I\u2019ve used for years.  Do not use black poster board as it has acid that will degrade the paper.  Some paper is thick enough that the reverse image does not show at all, so white backing is fine.  Please let me know if you have more questions about this process.  \r\n\r\n----- SHOULD I FRAME THE WHOLE PAGE OR ONLY THE ILLUSTRATION? -----\r\nIf framing, you may choose to showcase the entire advertisement or only the illustrated section.  It really depends on whether you are collecting the advertisement or artwork (or both).  An example are the 1950s Saturday Evening Post covers, which had a fair amount of print toward the top and a fun illustration toward the bottom 3\/4.  If you collect Post covers, you would probably frame the entire cover, words and all.  If you just love the nostalgic image but find the words distracting, you may decide to show only the illustrated portion.  I think both options are fine, but some purists would disagree with me.  My main interest is seeing these colorful gems preserved and enjoyed.  Keep in mind a mat covers up part of the page, so you can frame it while leaving the full page intact.","policy_seller_info":null,"policy_updated_tsz":1441058122,"vacation_autoreply":null,"url":"https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/shop\/RetroReveries?utm_source=theironyardteaching&utm_medium=api&utm_campaign=api","image_url_760x100":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/045\/0\/9430690\/iusb_760x100.14408385_7pdq.jpg","num_favorers":352,"languages":["en-US"],"upcoming_local_event_id":null,"icon_url_fullxfull":null}}],"params":{"limit":25,"offset":0,"page":null,"keywords":"whiskey","sort_on":"created","sort_order":"down","min_price":null,"max_price":null,"color":null,"color_accuracy":0,"tags":null,"category":null,"location":null,"lat":null,"lon":null,"region":null,"geo_level":"city","accepts_gift_cards":"false","translate_keywords":"false"},"type":"Listing","pagination":{"effective_limit":25,"effective_offset":0,"next_offset":25,"effective_page":1,"next_page":2}}
